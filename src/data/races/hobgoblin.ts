                Hobgoblins are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss
                with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the
                number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't
                use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
