                    A child of the sea, you can call on the magic of elemental air and water. You can cast fog cloud with this trait.
                    Starting at 3rd level, you can cast gust of wind with it, and starting at 5th level, you can also cast wall of water
                    with it (see the spell in the sidebar). Once you cast a spell with this trait, you can't do so again until you finish
                    a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
