            When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on
            the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because
            you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that wiII meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will
            determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected
            to assist the crew during the voyage.
