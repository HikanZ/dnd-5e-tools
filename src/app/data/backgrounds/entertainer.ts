        description: `
            You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a
            noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality
            of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure.
            When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.
