# TODO List

This is just a list of development tasks and ideas that I keep track of that either aren't fleshed out enough, or too much minutiae, to be part of the GitHub project.

## Things Needing Code

* Add the ability to export to markdown.
* Allow certain personality traits/bonds to be determined by alignment.
* Save last filter settings to local storage and re-populate on load.

## Ideas

* Patterned name generators for books, meals, wands, etc.
  * For example: "The Tome of {adjective} {noun}".
