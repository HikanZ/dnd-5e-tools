# TODO List

This is just a list of development tasks and ideas that I keep track of that either aren't fleshed out enough, or too much minutiae, to be part of a GitHub project.

## Ideas

* Patterned name generators for books, meals, wands, etc.
  * For example: "The Tome of {adjective} {noun}".

* Loot generator
 * Based on DMG tables.
