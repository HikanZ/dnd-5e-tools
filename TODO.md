# TODO List

This is just a list of development tasks and ideas that I keep track of that either aren't fleshed out enough, or too much minutiae, to be part of the GitHub project.

## Things Needing Code

* Allow certain personality traits/bonds to be determined by alignment.
* Save last filter settings to local storage and re-populate on load.
* Implement weapon, armor and tool proficiencies.
* Add source links to features.
* Add option for disabling some sources.
* Add background tool proficiencies.
* Add background equipment.
* Add background features.

* Allow stat generation methods:

  6d4 drop lowest
  6d4 drop lowest (no more than 1 negs)
  6d4 drop lowest (no more than 2 negs)

* Option for just re-roll stats.

## Ideas

* Patterned name generators for books, meals, wands, etc.
  * For example: "The Tome of {adjective} {noun}".
